There are some issues with the g++
I found that using this works:

~/code/cpp_projects/eclipse/workspace/TestRtMidi/Debug$ g++  -o "TestRtMidi"  ./src/TestRtMidi2.o ./src/midiprobe.o   -l rtmidi
#Note ommitting "lib" prefix and ".so"  suffix 
It will find it in the default search path

For thread support we need to add an option to the compilers and linkers:

1. Open project properties
2. C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Gcc C++ Compilers -> Miscelenous -> Other Flags -> add the -pthred (Actually we do not need it here)
3. C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Gcc C Compilers -> Miscelenous -> Other Flags -> add the -pthred (Actually we do not need it here)
4. C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Gcc C++ Linker -> Miscelenous -> Linker Flags -> add the -pthred (This is required for the linker to work)
